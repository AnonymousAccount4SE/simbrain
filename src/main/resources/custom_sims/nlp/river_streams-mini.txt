A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river.

In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water.
Small rivers can be referred to using names such as creek, brook, rivulet, and rill.

A stream is a continuous body of surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel.

A stream smaller than a creek, especially one that is fed by a spring or seep. It is usually small and easily forded. A brook is characterised by its shallowness.

A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, and distinct from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake.

An ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided.

Strictly speaking, a "sea" is a body of water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

The word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea.

There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas) or wholly (as inland seas) bordered by land.
