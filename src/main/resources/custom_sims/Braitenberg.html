<h1>Braitenberg Vehicles</h1>
(Based on work by Scott Hotton and Jeff Yoshimi)
<br><br>
In this simulation you can set the weights of two Braitenberg vehicles
and observe the behaviors that result.   By using the sample parameters
below you can produce revolving behaviors where the two vehicles revolve
around each other, or translating behaviors where they move alongside one
another.
<br><br>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
To start try pressing the <b>pursuer's</b> button.   This sets both agents to having the same
weights as is in the set weights dialog.   Then move the two agents to being within
range of each other.   Then press run.  They should eventually settle in to
stable behavior (these are "attracting relative equilibria").
<br><br>
Having done that, you can try setting other parameter values listed below, to
see other kinds of stable behaviors.   These will be various versions of
revolving around each other, including "meanders" where they are spinning
while they revolve around each other.
<br><br>
By pressing the <b>Reverse weights</b> button vehicle 2's weights are set to
be the reverse of vehicle 1's weights (vehicle 2's left weight is vehicle 1's
right weight, and  vehicle 2's right weight becomes vehicle 1's left weight.
When this is done (and obviously when vehicle 1's weights are different) then
the stable behavior tends to be translating.   The two vehicles trave alongside
one another.  Meanders can happen in this case too.
<br>
<h2>Sample parameter values</h2>
Enter the values below in the left weight and right weight fields, then press the button indicated, then press
run to see the corresponding behavior.
<br>
<br>
(100, 50) - Press pursuers.  Right classical revolving
<br>
(100,90) - Press pursuers then reverse.  Right meander with long straight lines
<br>
(50,55) - Press pursuers then reverse.  Translating type meander should result.
<br>
(20, 25) - Press pursuers then reverse.  Heart shaped translating.
