/**
 * Maintains a specific strategy for creating connections between two groups of neurons. Subclasses correspond to
 * specific types of connection strategy. Methods for creating free synapses are generally distinct from those for
 * creating them in synapse groups. Another distinction is between strategies that use polarity and those that do not.
 *
 * Note that connections are generally made in the following order.
 * 1) Weights are made using this class
 * 2) Their excitatory / inhibitory ratio is set using [ConnectionUtilities.polarizeSynapses]
 * for free synapses, or [SynapseGroup.setExcitatoryRatio] in synapse groups
 * 3) The two sets of weights are then randomized using probability distributions.
