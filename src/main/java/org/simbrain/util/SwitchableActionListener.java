import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

/**
 * A custom action listener which can be turned off and on. Essentially, all
 * that has been added is a boolean variable which is meant to show whether or
 * not this listener is active (true by default). When supplying the method
 * actionPerformed(...) the option is then available to use this flag to define
 * conditions under which the performed action should or should not be executed.
 * The intention is to allow for an easy way for components to make changes to
 * other components in the UI without setting off their action listener, thus
 * starting an infinite loop. In practice it allows for easy differentiating on
 * the part of the code between user induced actions and model-induced actions.
