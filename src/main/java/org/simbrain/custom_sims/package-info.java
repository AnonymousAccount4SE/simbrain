/**
 * This package contains custom simulations, preferably each in its own
 * sub-directory of ./simulations. This supplements the scripting framework by
 * allowing custom simulations to be created directly in an IDE. Helper classes
 * are in ./helper_classes.  To show up in Simbrain desktop, simulations must
 * be registered in RegisteredSimulations.java.
 * <br>
 * Resources like html files for simulations should be placed in the resources/customsims folder.
