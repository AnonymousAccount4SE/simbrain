<h1>Introduction</h1>
Sorry, nothing here yet!<br>
<h1>Tutorial</h1>
Here are some things you can do with this simulation in its current state:<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Make a critter speak:</b> Being near other critters makes critters more chatty, but there is a way to
        encourage them to talk even if there's noone else around. Activating the "Mouse" neuron in the Perception lobe
        will encourage your critter to say what's on it's mind. Activating the "Pain", "Comfort", and "Speak" neurons in
        the perception lobe will also have this effect. Activating the "Speak" neuron in the decision lobe directly will
        also work.
    <li><b>Approach something:</b> Hungry critters are more inclined to approach objects in their enviroment. Activating
        the "Hunger" neuron in the perception lobe will encourage your critter to approach whatever object they're
        thinking about. Activating the "Approach" neuron in the perception lobe will also have this effect! Activating
        the "Approach" neuron in the decision lobe directly will also work.
    <li><b>Remote control:</b> Activating the "Forward", "Backward", "Left", and "Right" neurons in the perception or
        decision lobe will make your critter go forward, backwards, or turn left or right, respectively.
    <li><b>Watch chemical reactions:</b> To see what is happening in the biochemistry of your critters, make sure that
        "tempLogFlag" in the CreaturesBiochem java file is set to TRUE and you have the Java console (not the Simbrain
        console) open. With each time step you'll see that each creature's chemical reactions update in the console. If
        there is a high enough concentration of reactants for a reaction to occur, you'll see a print out of the changes
        in concentrations made by the chemical reaction too.
</ul>

<br>
This marks the end of the important stuff! If you'd like to read more, you can read these (unfinished) notes from an
earlier attempt at this sort of simulation:<br>

<h1>General Notes on the Creatures 1 Brain</h1>
All dendrites in <i>Creatures</i> have two types of weights: A <u>long term weight (LTW)</u> and a <u>short term weight
    (STW)</u>. The STW acts much like the synapse weights in <i>Simbrain</i> (as in it is multiplied by the activation
coming in and the result is
the activation that is sent out), but the value of an STW will fluctuate and relax back to the LTW. The LTW will also
rise up to meet the STW (if it's within bounds), but the rate at which it rises is much slower than the rate at which
STW relaxes towards LTW.<br>
<br>
In <i>Creatures</i>, some dendrites are capable of migrating when certain criteria are met (such as low strength) [2].
This isn't possible in <i>Simbrain</i> (at least not without scripting), so this feature is not included in this
model.<br>
Likewise, there is reinforcement learning in <i>Creatures</i>, such that when a reinforcement or punishment chemical is
introduced in a creature's bloodstream, the positive or negative STWs of the dendrites connecting to Lobe 6 are
strengthened (based on their
current <u>susceptibility</u> levels), respectively [2]. This also isn't possible in <i>Simbrain</i> without scripting,
and as such is not part of the model.<br>
<br>
The literature doesn't state this outright, but the terminology that is used suggests to me that the brains in <i>Creatures</i>
use spiking activations. As such, the original plan was to use spiking neurons in this <i>Simbrain</i> simulation.
However, spiking
activations did not play nicely with the winner-take-all neuron groups I needed to make, so that was swapped for more
basic types of update rules.<br>
<br>
In <i>Creatures</i>, all numerical values in the genetics of a creature have a <u>minimum</u> of <b>0</b> and a <u>maximum</u>
of <b>255</b>. I ran into issues when trying to implement this in <i>Simbrain</i>, so I scaled it down. And so, unless
otherwise noted,
all nodes in this workshop file have an <u>upper bound</u> of <b>5</b> and a <u>lower bound</u> of <b>0</b>. (It
probably didn't need to be such a drastic reduction, but its easy to work with until I can figure out something
better)<br>
<br>
All lobes in <i>Creatures</i> have a value called <u>Input gain</u>, but the paper doesn't really explain how it works
or what it does beyond, <i>"[it] modulates input. With high gain, the effects of input values are increased; with low
    gain, the effects of
    input</i> values are reduced." [2]. Nobody else seems to have a better explanation of what it means, so I've just
been ignoring it for now. But just in case you <i>do</i> have an idea of what to do with it (and have some idea on how
to implement it), I included
each lobe's input gain values in their descriptions.<br>
<br>
Due to the mutability of brain genetics in <i>Creatures</i> [2], whenever we are talking specifically about how the
brain works in game we are speaking mainly in reference to the "standard" brain most 1st-gen Norns start with.

<h1>Lobe 0: Perception</h1>
The Perception lobe acts as a central hub for activations from Lobes 1, 3, 5, and 7 to congregate, before moving on to
Lobe 8.<br>
<u>Fan-out</u> from this lobe goes to <b>Lobe 8</b> and <u>fan-in</u> comes in from <b>Lobes 1, 3, 5, and 7</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u>
are <b>7 x 16</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 0 is located at <b>(4, 13)</b> on the neural map. Each cell in the lobe has a <u>threshold</u>
of <b>10</b>, an <u>input gain</u> of <b>255</b>, and they <u>leak</u> to their <u>rest state</u> of <b>0</b> in almost
an
<b>instant (0)</b>.<br>
<br>
It has <b>no</b> genetically defined <u>cell body or dendrite state variable rules</u>.<br>
<br>
Something unique to Lobe 0 in <i>Creatures 1</i> is that it doesn't use dendrites to recieve activation from its four
input lobes. Due to the limited number of fan-in dendrite types available (only two!) per lobe, a workaround was created
such that every lobe
has a genetically-defined <u>"Copy Data to Perception Lobe" (CDPL) flag</u>. If the flag is checked "Yes" or "Mutually
Exclusive", then all the activations in that lobe is copied to an allocated range of nodes within The Perception Lobe.
The difference between
these two flags is that, for a "Mutually Exclusive" lobe, only one node at max from that lobe will contribute activation
to any particular concept node. So a creature would be incapable of conceptualizing something like, "I'm bored AND I'm
tired" [1].<br>
<br>
The ranges are [1]:<br>
<b>0-15:</b> Lobe 1<br>
<b>16-31:</b> Lobe 3<br>
<b>32-63:</b> Lobe 5<br>
<b>64-103:</b> Lobe 7
<h2>In Simbrain:</h2>
Because <i>Simbrain</i> does not have such a tight limit on how many neuron groups can fan-in to one group, we have the
option of creating fan-in loose or grouped synapses from all four input lobes to The Perception Lobe. Since different
ranges of nodes within
the Perception lobe neuron group correspond to different lobes, loose synapses had to be used instead of synapse groups
or vector coupling.<br>
There doesn't seem to be a way I can implement mutual exclusitivity that wouldn't be too time-costly, so that's not
here.<br>
<br>
The same ranges of nodes used in <i>Creatures 1</i> are used here.<br>
<br>
The Perception lobe is a group of <b>112 linear</b> <u>neurons</u>. It has <b>104</b> <u>fan-in synapses</u>, all which
have a <u>strength</u> of <b>1</b> and are <b>static</b>.

<h1>Lobe 1: Drives</h1>
The activation of nodes in the Drive lobe are matched to the level of respective "drive chemicals" in the creature's
body, with each node representing a different drive. The receptors that control these matches are genetically defined
[2].<br>
<u>Fan-out</u> from this lobe goes to <b>Lobe 0</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u> are <b>8 x 2</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 1 is located at <b>(34, 40)</b> on the neural map and is checked <b>"Mutually
    Exclusive"</b> on its <u>CDPL flag</u>. Each cell in the lobe has a <u>threshold</u> of <b>24</b>, an <u>input
    gain</u> of <b>255</b>, and they
<u>leak</u> to their <u>rest state</u> of <b>0</b> in almost an <b>instant (0)</b><br>
<br>
It has <b>no</b> genetically defined <u>cell body or dendrite state variable rules</u>.
<h2>In Simbrain:</h2>
The Drive lobe is a group of <b>16 linear</b> <u>neurons</u> that are currently <b>clamped</b> for user input.<br>
<br>
Some of the labels for the nods of this lobe have been shortened so as to not overlap with other labels. The ones that
have shortened are listed below, along with their full name [1]:<br>
<b>NFP:</b> Need for Pleasure
<b>Cold:</b> Coldness
<b>Hot:</b> Hotness
<b>Tired:</b> Tiredness
<b>Sleepy:</b> Sleepiness
<b>Lonely:</b> Loneliness
<b>Crowded:</b> Overcrowdedness
<b>Bored:</b> Boredom
<br>
Before switching to this lighter version, this lobe recieved activations from a vector coupling to an array of decay
neurons in the "Agent" network, which would either slowly "decay" upwards or downwards at different rates, depending on
the specific drive.<br>
If I had gotten farther before I quitted for computational reasons, the next step would've been to create a series of
AND gates that would send activation to these drive controllers based on activation from the Attention lobe, the
Decision lobes, and a group of
smell detector nodes. So, for example, if the "push" node from The Decision Lobe and the "food" node from The Attention
Lobe fired, the activation in the hunger drive node would decrease in proportion to the amount of "food" smell The Agent
was detecting. How
well this plan would've work in practice is a mystery to me.

<h1>Lobe 2: Stimulus Source</h1>
Each neuron in this lobe corresponds to an object category that the creatures can see [2].<br>
<u>Fan-out</u> from this lobe goes to <b>Lobe 7</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u> are <b>5 x 8</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
Activations for Lobe 2 are computated directly by the <i>Creatures</i> engine, based on various factors such as
line-of-sight, object scripts, and the stimulus genes for that particular creature [1].<br>
<br>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 2 is located at <b>(15, 24)</b> on the neural map and is <b>winner-take-all</b>.
Each cell in the lobe has a <u>threshold</u> of <b>0</b>, an <u>input gain</u> of <b>255</b>, and they <u>leak</u> to
their <u>rest state</u> of
<b>0</b> in about <b>1 second (16)</b>.<br>
<br>
It has <b>no</b> genetically defined <u>cell body or dendrite state variable rules</u>.
<h2>In Simbrain:</h2>
The Stimulus Source lobe is a group of <b>40 linear</b> <u>neurons</u> that are currently <b>clamped</b> for user input.<br>
<br>
Before switching to this lighter version, the Stimulus Source lobe was a winner-take-all neuron group that recieved
activation from a vector coupling to a <i>"Summed Smell Matrix" (SSM)</i> in the "Agent" network. The SSM is fairly
self-explanatory: it takes in
activations from one-to-one connections with three more smell matrixes (one for each of The Agent's smell sensors in
Odor World) and adds them together. Since each index in the smell vector represents a different category of object (same
categories as in
<i>Creatures</i>), The Agent would've been able to detect what kinds of objects are close to it - and hopefully act
accordingly. A quirk of this system is that an object in the odor world could be in several different categories, which
isn't possible in
<i>Creatures</i>. I wasn't planning on having multi-categorical objects in the odor world, but maybe that would be
something to try out in the future?

<h1>Lobe 3: Verbs</h1>
Each neuron in this lobe corresponds to a different verb the creature can hear [1].<br>
<u>Fan-out</u> from this lobe goes to <b>Lobe 0</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u> are <b>8 x 2</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
Activations for Lobe 3 are computated directly by the <i>Creatures</i> engine based on what verbs the creature hears
[1].<br>
<br>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 3 is located at <b>(37, 24)</b> on the neural map, is <b>winner-take-all</b>, and is
checked <b>"Mutually Exclusive"</b> on it's <u>CDPL flag</u>. Each cell has a <u>threshold</u> of <b>0</b>, an <u>input
    gain</u> of <b>255</b>,
and they <u>leak</u> to their <u>rest state</u> of <b>0</b> in about <b>5 seconds (32)</b>.<br>
<br>
It has <b>no</b> genetically defined <u>cell body or dendrite state variable rules</u>.
<h2>In Simbrain:</h2>
The Verb lobe is a group of <b>16 linear</b> <u>neurons</u> that are currently <b>clamped</b> for user input.<br>
<br>
Before switching to this lighter version, the Verb lobe was a winner-take-all neuron group. The plan was to have a
reader world that the user can type into: If the user types in verbs or nouns that are recognized, an agent representing
the user ("hand") would say
those words. If The Agent's hearing detected the speech, then the respective words in the Verb and Noun lobes would
activate.

<h1>Lobe 4: Nouns</h1>
Each neuron in this lobe corresponds to a different noun that the creature can hear [1].<br>
<u>Fan-out</u> from this lobe goes to <b>Lobe 7</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u> are <b>20 x 2</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
Activations for Lobe 4 are computated directly by the <i>Creatures</i> engine based on what nouns the creature hears, or
if the user moves their hand over an object and says "look" (in which case the it's word for that object that is
activated) [1].<br>
<br>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 4 is located at <b>(21, 3)</b> on the neural map, and is <b>winner-take-all</b>.
Each cell has a <u>threshold</u> of <b>0</b>, an <u>input gain</u> of <b>255</b>, and they <u>leak</u> to their <u>rest
    state</u> of <b>0</b> in
about <b>5 seconds (32)</b>.<br>
<br>
It has <b>no</b> genetically defined <u>cell body or dendrite state variable rules</u>.
<h2>In Simbrain:</h2>
The Noun lobe is a group of <b>40 linear</b> <u>neurons</u> that are currently <b>clamped</b> for user input.<br>
<br>
Before switching to this lighter version, the Noun lobe was a winner-take-all neuron group. The plan was to have a
reader world that the user can type into: If the user types in verbs or nouns that are recognized, an agent representing
the user ("hand") would say
those words. If The Agent's hearing detected the speech, then the respective words in the Verb and Noun lobes would
activate.

<h1>Lobe 5: General Senses</h1>
It's a bit difficult for me to explain or paraphrase what this lobe does, so I'll quote from Chris Double:<br>
<i>"The cells in this lobe define what the norn can currently sense in the environment. Where the stimulus source lobe
    is the objects within the environment this lobe is various environmental factors relating to those objects. For
    example, cells for detecting that
    the creatures has just been patted, slapped, fallen, whether nearby creatures are the same sex, same species, the
    parents of the current creature, etc."</i> [1].<br>
<br>
<u>Fan-out</u> from this lobe goes to <b>Lobe 0</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u> are <b>8 x 4</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
Activations for Lobe 5 are computated based on stimulus genes, objects scripts, and inputs made directly by the <i>Creatures</i>
engine.<br>
<br>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 5 is located at <b>(32, 34)</b> on the neural map and is checked <b>"Yes"</b> on
it's <u>CDPL flag</u>. Each cell has a <u>threshold</u> of <b>0</b>, an <u>input gain</u> of <b>255</b>, and they <u>leak</u>
to their <u>rest
    state</u> of <b>0</b> in about <b>3 seconds (24)</b>.<br>
<br>
It has <b>no</b> genetically defined <u>cell body or dendrite state variable rules</u>.
<h2>In Simbrain:</h2>
The General Sensory lobe is a group of <b>32 linear</b> <u>neurons</u> that are currently <b>clamped</b> for user input.<br>
<br>
The labels for the nodes of this lobe have been shortened so as to not overlap with other labels. The ones that have
shortened are listed below, along with their full name [1]:<br>
<b>Patted:</b> I've been patted<br>
<b>Slapped:</b> I've been slapped<br>
<b>Bump w.:</b> I've bumped into a wall<br>
<b>Near w.:</b> I am near a wall<br>
<b>in veh.:</b> I am in a vehicle<br>
<b>U. speak:</b> User has spoken<br>
<b>C. speak:</b> Creature has spoken<br>
<b>K. speak:</b> Own kind has spoken<br>
<b>Audible e.:</b> Audible event<br>
<b>Visible e.:</b> Visible event<br>
<b>It appr.:</b> It is approaching<br>
<b>It retreat:</b> It is retreating<br>
<b>It near:</b> It is near me<br>
<b>It active:</b> It is active<br>
<b>is object:</b> It is an object<br>
<b>is crea.:</b> It is a creature<br>
<b>is sibling:</b> It is my sibling<br>
<b>is parent:</b> It is my parent<br>
<b>is child:</b> It is my child<br>
<b>Opp. sex:</b> It is opposite sex<br>
<br>
Out of all of the brain lobes, I had the least idea of how to integrate this lobe with the enviroment beyond the brain.
Most of these concepts (such as "i've bumped into a wall") aren't something that can be done in Simbrain (not without
scripting, anyway), and
many of the ones that could would require a lot more effort to work around than I would need for most other shortcuts
(such as creating lines of entities in odor world with a specific scent that represents "I'm near a wall" when smelled).
Of what I could do, I
had only intended to implement "User/Creature/Own Kind has spoken", "Audible event", "it is near me", and "it is an
object/creature", all of which could be done by pulling the activations of the pre-existing smell/hearing sensors and/or
Attention lobe through
various AND gates.

<h1>Lobe 6: Decisions</h1>
The Decision lobe decides on a course of action based on activation from the Concept lobe. The dendrites of fanning-in
from the Concept lobe to the Decicion lobe acts as a sort of "relational memory" storage [2].<br>
<br>
<u>Fan-in</u> comes in from <b>Lobe 8</b>. Its <u>dimensions</u> are <b>1 x 16</b>.
<h2>In Creatures 1:</h2>
The <u>upperleft corner</u> of Lobe 6 is located at <b>(53, 15)</b> on the neural map and is <b>winner-take-all</b>.
Each cell has a <u>threshold</u> of <b>0</b>, an <u>input gain</u> of <b>128</b>, and they <u>leak</u> to a <u>rest
    state</u> of <b>80</b> in
about <b>3 seconds (24)</b>.<br>
<br>
The <u>state variable rule</u> of the <u>cell bodies</u> is as follows:<br>
<b>state PLUS type0 MINUS type1</b><br>
This was one of the examples of a cell body state variable rule given in reference #2. What this particular rule means
is the activation of all cells in this lobe are calculated by taking the prior activation and adding the incoming type0
inputs and subtracting
the incoming type0 inputs.<br>
<br>
All dendrites of <u>Type 0 and 1</u> <u>fan-in</u> from <b>Lobe 8</b>. The <u>number of dendrites</u> of will always be
<b>128</b>. They are <u>spread</u> out in a <b>"--- flat" (0)</b> shape and have a <u>fanout</u> value of <b>8</b>. The
<u>LTW</u> will always
start out at <b>0</b>, but the <u>strength</u> of a dendrite link can range between <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>. The <u>susceptibility</u>
of these dendrites to reinforcement will <u>relax</u> back to zero in about <b>20 seconds (48)</b>. The time it take for
the <u>STW</u> to
relax back to the <u>LTW</u> is <b>5 minutes (80)</b>. The time it takes for the <u>LTW</u> to <u>rise (gain)</u> to the
same level of STW is <b>5 hours (128)</b>.<br>
