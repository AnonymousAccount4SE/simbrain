<body>
The <b>world.odorworld.effectors</b> package contains effects that can be added to objects to allow
them to move in custom ways.

NOTE (1/11): Initially there were several effectors in this package but they were
refactored to simple methods of RotatingEntity.java. Hence the package is currently empty.
