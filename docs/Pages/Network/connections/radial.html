<h1>Radial Connection<br>
</h1><br>
<p>
Radial connection will connect a given neuron to all neurons within a
certain radius with a certain probability. The probability of forming
inhibitory and excitatory connections are set separately as well as the
<a href="../synapse.html">synapse type</a>
associated with each type of connection. If a set of neurons are
selected then connections will be made with the specified probabilities
from each individual neuron, as when only one is selected.
</p>

<p> There are two types of radial connections in Simbrain. </p>

<blockquote><h2>Radial (Simple)</h2>
            <p>This connection type connects neurons in succession from a starting point. This creates weights in a directed manner and activation radiates outward from the starting point or initial site of activation. This type of radial connection is termed “simple” as it is the most basic radial pattern of activation. </p>
            <h2>Radial</h2>
            <p>This connection type is like the Radial (Simple) type, but with more variations in how synapses radiate outward. This pattern is less predictable the the simple model.</p>
