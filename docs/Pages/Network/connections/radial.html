        <h1>Radial Connection<br>
        </h1><br>
        <p>
            Radial connection will connect a given neuron to all neurons within a
            certain radius with a certain probability. The probability of forming
            inhibitory and excitatory connections are set separately as well as the
            <a href="../synapse.html">synapse type</a>
            associated with each type of connection. If a set of neurons are
            selected then connections will be made with the specified probabilities
            from each individual neuron, as when only one is selected.
        </p>
        <p>A Radial connection type is like the Radial (Simple) type, but with more variations in how synapses radiate outward. This pattern is less predictable than that of the simple model.</p>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p> Distance Drop-off: The distance (in pixels) of activation drop off. </p>
            <p> Exc. -> Exc. Constant: The Excitatory-to-Excitatory synapse constant, ranges from 0 to 1.</p>
            <p> Exc. -> Inh. Constant: The Excitatory-to-Inhibitory synapse constant, ranges from 0 to 1.</p>
            <p> Inh. -> Exc. Constant: The Inhibitory-to-Excitatory synapse constant, ranges from 0 to 1.</p>
            <p> Inh. -> Inh. Constant: The Inhibitory-to-Inhibitory synapse constant, ranges from 0 to 1.</p>
            <p> No Polarity Constant: The connection probability for non-polar synapses.</p>
