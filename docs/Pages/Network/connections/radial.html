        <h1>Radial Connection<br>
        </h1><br>
        <p>
            A radial connection will connect a given neuron to all neurons within a
            certain radius with a certain probability. The probability of forming
            inhibitory and excitatory connections are set separately as well as the
            <a href="../synapse.html">synapse type</a>
            associated with each type of connection. If a set of neurons are
            selected then connections will be made with the specified probabilities
            from each individual neuron, as when only one is selected.
        </p>
        <p>A Radial connection type is like the Radial (Simple) type, but with more variations in how synapses radiate outward. This pattern is less predictable than that of the simple model.</p>
