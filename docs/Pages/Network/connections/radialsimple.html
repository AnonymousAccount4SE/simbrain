        <h1>Radial (Simple) Connection<br>
        </h1><br>
            <p>
            A radial connection will connect a given neuron to all neurons within a
            certain radius with a certain probability. The probability of forming
            inhibitory and excitatory connections are set separately as well as the
            <a href="../synapse.html">synapse type</a>
            associated with each type of connection. If a set of neurons are
            selected then connections will be made with the specified probabilities
            from each individual neuron, as when only one is selected.
            </p>
            <p>The Simple Radial connection type connects neurons in succession from a starting point. This creates weights in a directed manner and activation radiates outward from the starting point or initial site of activation. This type of radial connection is "simple' as it is the most basic radial pattern of activation. </p>
