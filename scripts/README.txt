SIMBRAIN SCRIPTING

This directory and its subdirectories hold beanshell scripts. Most scripting now is done in the intellij IDSE.

The syntax for these scripts is java (with some modifications).  In each case some base object is made available that you can modify using java commands. The best way to learn how to write these scripts is probably to just look (and modify)  existing scripts.  Also see http://www.beanshell.org/docs.html

Scripts in ./console are available from the Simbrain console (from which command line arguments can be issued) or terminal components. The objects available here are the same as with scriptmenu.
